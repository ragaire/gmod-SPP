# gmod-SPP
Simple prop protection, more like anti crash. Stops prop cramming by automatically no-colliding props owned by the same owner. Most POWERFUL anti prop-surf ever made - probably.

### MADE FOR A SERVER 
This was made for Benji's RP. I made it as i went on , and added things i felt was needed. No config file is included obviously because its so simple anyone with half a monkey brain can figure it out. 

### INSTALLATION
Put in garrysmod/addons & edit as you see fit

### What does it do? 
It no-collides all props owned by the same players, and allows collision for props not owned by the same players. It virtually eliminates prop cramming (crash attempts), but obviously doesnt take into account entities or whatever .

It stops prop killing, vehicle killing

It stops prop SURFING; prop surfing is impossible, literally, i think.

It stops prop push

### closing notes
Bravo!
